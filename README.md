> A macOS menu bar widget that shows your remaining **Claude Code** and **Codex** usage limits as battery icons — so you never have to open `/usage` again.

</p>

`C` = Claude · `X` = Codex. Each battery's **fill and color** show how much of a limit window is left — a full green battery means plenty, an empty red one means almost out. Click for a detailed breakdown with exact percentages and reset times.

Built as a single [SwiftBar](https://github.com/swiftbar/SwiftBar) plugin — one self-contained script, **no third-party libraries** and no `npm install`. The battery icons are **native macOS SF Symbols** (vector — crisp at any resolution), tinted per-battery by SwiftBar. Network calls: **one to Anthropic's official usage endpoint** (the same data `/usage` shows, fetched with your own local Claude Code login — [see Privacy](#privacy--security)) and an **optional once-a-day update check** ([see Updating](#updating)). (`ccusage` is an optional extra for the cost breakdown.)

## What it shows

| Group | Batteries | Source |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| **`C` Claude** | 5-hour session · weekly · **Fable** (top-model weekly cap) | Anthropic's OAuth usage API — queried live with your local Claude Code login; **account-level**, so usage from every device/surface is included |
| **`X` Codex** | 5-hour · weekly (or credit balance on the premium plan) | `~/.codex/sessions/**/*.jsonl` → `rate_limits` |

Click the widget for a dropdown with, per limit:

```

```

Colors follow a 5-step scale on the remaining %: 🟢 green (> 80) · 🟩 lime (> 60) · 🟡 yellow (> 40) · 🟠 orange (> 20) · 🔴 red (≤ 20).

## Requirements

| | Required? | Install |
|---|---|---|
| **macOS** | ✅ | — |
| **[SwiftBar](https://github.com/swiftbar/SwiftBar)** | ✅ | **`install.sh` offers to install it** (via Homebrew, or the GitHub release if you don't have brew) |
| **[bun](https://bun.sh)** | ✅ | **`install.sh` offers to install it** (official installer: `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install \| bash`) |
| **Claude Code** | ✅ for `C` batteries | just needs to be **logged in** on this Mac (the widget reuses its login to query the usage API) |
| **Codex CLI** | optional | for the `X` batteries; without it, only Claude is shown |
| **[ccusage](https://github.com/ryoppippi/ccusage)** | optional | adds the cost / token / per-model breakdown in the dropdown — **the battery works fully without it** |

> **Note:** This widget shows *your own account's* limits — via your local Claude Code login and your local Codex session logs. If you don't use Claude Code (or Codex), there simply won't be any data to display.

---

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jason191188/claude-codex-battery.git
cd claude-codex-battery
./install.sh
```

`install.sh` will:

1. Check for **bun** and **SwiftBar** — and **offer to install them** if missing (bun via its official installer; SwiftBar via Homebrew, or the GitHub release zip if you don't have brew)
2. Copy the plugin into `~/.swiftbar-plugins/`, rewriting the shebang to your machine's `bun` path *(SwiftBar runs plugins with a minimal `PATH`, so an absolute shebang is required)*
3. Point SwiftBar at the plugin folder and launch it
4. Register SwiftBar as a login item, so the battery comes back automatically after a reboot

No `npm install`, no bundled libraries — the plugin is a single self-contained script.

The battery appears in your menu bar within a few seconds. It refreshes **every 2 minutes** (the `.2m.` in the filename).

### Manual install

If you prefer not to run the script:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.swiftbar-plugins
# rewrite shebang to your bun path, then copy:
sed "1s|.*|#!$(command -v bun)|" claude-codex-usage.2m.js > ~/.swiftbar-plugins/claude-codex-usage.2m.js
chmod +x ~/.swiftbar-plugins/claude-codex-usage.2m.js
defaults write com.ameba.SwiftBar PluginDirectory -string ~/.swiftbar-plugins
open -a SwiftBar
```

---

## Updating

The widget checks GitHub for a newer version **at most once a day** — a tiny background request for the `VERSION` file. When a new version is out, a green **🆕 update** row appears in the dropdown; click it to replace the plugin in place and refresh (your previous copy is kept as `.bak`). There's also an always-visible **⬆️ update now** row that replaces the plugin with the latest `main` on demand — no waiting for the daily check.

Prefer to do it yourself? From your clone: `git pull && ./install.sh`.

To turn the check off entirely, comment out the `getUpdateInfo()` call near the bottom of the script — then the only network call left is the Anthropic usage query.

---

## Privacy & security

- **Claude limits come straight from Anthropic.** The widget reads your Claude Code OAuth token from the macOS Keychain (item `Claude Code-credentials`) and calls `api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage` — the same endpoint `/usage` uses. The token is sent **only to api.anthropic.com**, passed via stdin (never visible in `ps`), and never written to disk or logs. macOS may show a one-time Keychain permission prompt — click **Always Allow**. (Clicking *Deny* makes macOS re-prompt on every refresh — if you'd rather the widget never touch the Keychain, run `touch ~/.claude/swiftbar/.no-live` instead; it then reads local cache files only, like v1.1.)
- **No other secrets read.** Codex `auth.json` and API keys are never touched.
- **No usage data leaves your machine.** Nothing is uploaded anywhere; the only outbound calls are the Anthropic usage query above and the optional daily update check ([Updating](#updating)).
- **No conversation content.** From Codex session logs it parses only the `rate_limits` object (numbers), never the messages.
- **Auditable in one sitting.** The whole widget is a single dependency-free script — grep for `curl`/`fetch` and you've seen every network call it can make.

---

## How accurate / in-sync is it?

**Claude — live.** Every refresh queries Anthropic's usage API directly with your local Claude Code login — the *same* server-side data `/usage` shows, so the numbers match it by construction. Because the limits are **account-level**, usage from every surface and device (terminal, desktop app, web, another machine) is already included. If the query fails (offline, logged out), the widget falls back to its last successful response and labels the reading with its age in amber.

**Codex — as fresh as your last Codex run.** Codex writes rate-limit data to its session logs *only while you use it*, and records no reset time. So the value is a snapshot from your most recent session — the dropdown labels it "measured N ago" and warns past 3h. Run Codex and it re-syncs instantly.

**TL;DR** — Claude is live (same source as `/usage`); Codex is a clearly-labeled snapshot from your last session, not a live feed.

---

## How it works

The whole thing is one `.js` file run by bun on a timer.

- **Battery icons** are native macOS **SF Symbols** (`battery.0` / `.25` / `.50` / `.75` / `.100`), rendered inline in the menu bar and tinted per-battery with SwiftBar's `sfcolor` (a 5-step color scale). Being vector, they stay crisp at any resolution — no bitmaps, no image library. The fill maps to the nearest quarter; the *exact* percentage lives in the dropdown. A `C` / `X` text label marks the groups, and the big/small size presets map to the SF symbol `size=`.
- **Claude limits** are fetched from Anthropic's OAuth usage endpoint using the Claude Code login token in your Keychain, with the last good response cached at `~/.claude/swiftbar/.claude-usage.json` as an offline fallback. The Fable cap is the `weekly_scoped` entry.
- **Codex limits** come from the newest session's `rate_limits`. The premium plan reports a `credits` object instead of percentages when exhausted; the widget handles both shapes.

### Codex has one quirk

Codex only writes limit data to session logs **while you use it**, and doesn't record a reset time when exhausted. So if you haven't run Codex in a while, the value can be stale. The widget:

- flags values older than 3 hours in the dropdown, and
- **optionally** runs `codex exec --sandbox read-only` in the background to refresh — but *only* when Codex is exhausted **and** the value is 2h+ old, at most once every 6 hours (≈4×/day, ~20k tokens each).

If you'd rather it never spend tokens on its own, comment out the `maybeAutoRefreshCodex(codex)` call near the render section.

## Customizing

| Want to change | Where |
|---|---|
| Refresh interval | filename `.2m.` → `.1m.`, `.5m.`, `.30s.`, … |
| Battery size | **↕ row in the dropdown** — toggles between big (default) and small; stored in `~/.claude/swiftbar/.batt-size` |
| Show fewer batteries | **🔋 row in the dropdown** — toggles between all five (C5·CW·CF·X5·XW, default) and just the current 5-hour pair (C·X); stored in `~/.claude/swiftbar/.batt-mode` |
| Color scale | `heatRemainHex` (5 steps at 20 / 40 / 60 / 80 % remaining) |
| Disable Codex auto-refresh | comment out `maybeAutoRefreshCodex(codex)` |
| Disable live Claude API / Keychain access | `touch ~/.claude/swiftbar/.no-live` (falls back to local cache files) |
| Which Claude limits to show | the `battItems.push(...)` block |

## Why a SwiftBar plugin (and not a standalone app)?

A single script stays dependency-free, easy to audit, and trivial to fork — and its audience (Claude Code / Codex developers) already lives in the terminal, so `brew install swiftbar` is no barrier. A native `.app` would drop the SwiftBar requirement but adds a Swift codebase, Apple code-signing + notarization ($99/yr), and ongoing maintenance. **Roadmap:** if there's enough demand, ship a signed one-click menu-bar `.app` (likely bundling SwiftBar) for non-terminal users.
